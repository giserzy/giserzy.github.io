I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Institute of Space and Earth Information Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on using GeoAI and social sensing methods to study urban science, disaster response, and social inequality.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), social sensing, and urban studies:

- **Micro-scale Urban Perception**: Utilizing urban sensing devices and crowdsourced data for urban function and traffic modeling.
- **Disaster Emergency Management**: Integrating natural language processing with geo-tagged social media data for real-time, data-driven disaster response.
- **Social Isolation and Inequality**: Understanding urban human-social systems through analysis of spatiotemporal big data.

## Education

- Ph.D. in Cartography and Geographic Information Systems, Wuhan University, 2023
- Joint Ph.D. , The National Univeristy Of Singapore, 2022
- M.S. in Geomatics Engineering, Wuhan University, 2020
- B.S. in Geomatics Engineering, Wuhan University, 2018
