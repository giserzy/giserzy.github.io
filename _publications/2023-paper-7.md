**Key Points:**
- Developed a two-layer spatially dependent graph neural network
- Utilized time-series street view images for urban function identification
- Published in a high-impact journal (IF=11.774)
- Contributes to the field of urban science and remote sensing

**Additional Information:**
- This research is part of our ongoing work in urban function analysis and GeoAI
- The methodology can be applied to various urban planning and management scenarios
- Future work will focus on integrating this approach with other urban data sources
